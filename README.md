# My Game

Game developed with DragonRuby Game Toolkit - TeenTiny Edition for the [TeenyTiny DragonRuby MiniGameJam](https://itch.io/jam/teenytiny-dragonruby-minigamejam-2020)

## Kickoff

Nov 1, 2020.

## Jam Goals

Welcome to the TeenyTiny DragonRuby MiniGameJam where the goal is to make minigames that are small, simple and short.

This is a casual and beginner-friendly jam, and we want you to make a short and sweet game without any stress. All you need is an idea and the desire to build it into a tiny game. This is a non-competitive jam. No prizes will be awarded and there will be no judges or ratings. You may submit as many games as you like.

All games must be made using DragonRuby Game Toolkit. Free Game Jam licenses have been generously provided. You can claim your license here <http://teenytiny.dragonruby.org>.

## Theme

Make a minigame!

We want you to make a short minigame that can be finished in 20 seconds or less. Whether that means completing an objective within a time limit, a race to score as many points as possible before the clock runs down, or a fixed-length scripted level, short is the keyword of this jam.

Think about what makes a minigame work. Most minigames that we could think of implement some of the following ideas. Try to implement at least one of these:

- Limited Time: Keep the play session short. If you can't manage a 20 second time limit, try to stick with a bite-sized objective.
- Limited Controls: Use only one or two buttons. Make the player’s interaction options clear and simple.
- Limited Mechanics: Focus on a single core game mechanic and build the entire experience around it.

## Timeline

The official Jam runs throughout November with two weeks of post-jam activity. This is how we break it down:

- Pre-Jam (Nov 1 to 14): Think up ideas, get your tools together, learn what you need. You can also start development and submit games if you want.
- Jam (Nov 15 to 28): Make your games and submit them within this two week period.
- Post-Jam (Nov 29 to Dec 12): Play everyone else’s games and give feedback. You can tweak or improve your game or just keep developing it if you want to. 

We plan to create a TeenyTiny game launcher during the Post-Jam. If you want to be included in the TeenyTiny game launcher, we can help you to adapt your game(s) to work with the launcher.
